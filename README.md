# Project 2 : Web API Interaction

## Description
This project involves creating a web application that communicates with an external web API using the Fetch API. The application should utilize the data provided by the API to populate its content and features. Additionally, it allow user interaction through a select feature, that uses Fetch requests to retrieve associated data.

## Requirements

1. **API Interaction (20%)**
   - Use Fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API.
   - Populate the application's content and features with data from the API.

2. **User Interaction (15%)**
   - Implement a search feature, paginated gallery, or a similar functionality.
   - Use GET requests to retrieve associated data based on user interaction.

3. **Data Manipulation (15%)**
   - Enable user manipulation of data within the API.
   - Use POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, ensuring API support for these operations.

4. **Asynchronous Programming (15%)**
   - Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate.

5. **Modular Code Structure (3%)**
   - Organize JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files.
   - Import functions and data across files as necessary.

6. **JavaScript Event Loop (5%)**
   - Ensure the program runs as expected, without undesired behavior related to the JavaScript event loop (e.g., race conditions, out-of-order API calls).

7. **User Experience (5%)**
   - Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.

8. **Error-Free Execution (10%)**
   - Ensure the program runs without errors.
   - Comment out sections that do not work and provide explanations for blockers.

9. **Git Repository (10%)**
   - Commit frequently to the Git repository.
